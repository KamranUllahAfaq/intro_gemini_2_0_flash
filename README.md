# intro_gemini_2_0_flash
Gemini 2.0 Flash is a new multimodal generative ai model from the Gemini family developed by Google DeepMind. It is now available as an experimental preview release through the Gemini API in Vertex AI and Vertex AI Studio. The model introduces new features and enhanced core capabilities:

Multimodal Live API: This new API helps you create real-time vision and audio streaming applications with tool use.
Speed and performance: Gemini 2.0 Flash is the fastest model in the industry, with a 3x improvement in time to first token (TTFT) over 1.5 Flash.
Quality: The model maintains quality comparable to larger models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o.
Improved agentic experiences: Gemini 2.0 delivers improvements to multimodal understanding, coding, complex instruction following, and function calling.
New Modalities: Gemini 2.0 introduces native image generation and controllable text-to-speech capabilities, enabling image editing, localized artwork creation, and expressive storytelling.
To support the new model, we're also shipping an all new SDK that supports simple migration between the Gemini Developer API and the Gemini API in Vertex AI.
